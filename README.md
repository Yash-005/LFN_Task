# Anonymizing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Large Datasets

## Overview

In this repository, I've explored  different methods for anonymizing personally identifiable information (PII) in large datasets. I've discussed the use of regex and NLP techniques, as well as the potential application of LLM Transformer models.

## Methods

- **Regex Method**:  
  - Allows for precise identification and anonymization of PII by defining patterns and parsing through each dataset entry.  
  - Provides explicit control over the anonymization process but may require manual pattern definition and struggle with nuanced language or complex data structures.

- **NLP Method (Presidio)**:  
  - Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques with models like Presidio for automated anonymization.  
  - Offers predefined configurations and operators, simplifying the anonymization process and potentially improving accuracy, especially for less well-defined PII.  
  - Effectiveness may vary based on data complexity and model accuracy.
